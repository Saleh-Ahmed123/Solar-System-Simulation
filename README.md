# Basic Solar System Simulation
## This is an old version, my newest version which is much more advanced is being used for my Computer Science NEA so it cannot be shared here yet.

This was a play around and one of my first experiences with the matplotlib libary.

I am aware of the errors in the calculations of the orbital paths. However, this project was an opportunity to learn something new rather than build an accurate simulation.

So errors and all, enjoy one of my first projects.
